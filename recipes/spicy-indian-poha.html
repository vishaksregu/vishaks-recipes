        <h1>Spicy Indian Poha</h1>
        <img src="../images/poha.jpeg">
        <p> Poha has long been one of my staple, go-to breakfast recipes ever since I started living on my own. In fact, it was the breakfast I looked forward to the most even in Uni</p>
        <p> What I like the most about is that it is light, tasty, healthy and filling. And totally customizable</p>
        <p>You can make it with potatoes, without potatoes, with veggies, without veggies, with nuts, without nuts. You can have it with bhujia, lime, gupshup peanuts or any combination of the three</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
