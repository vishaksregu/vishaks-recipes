        <p> Upma is another of those recipes that I did not really appreciate for a long long time</p>
        <p> Growing up, upma was always a sweet breakfast. To be had with banana and sugar. And I never really got it</p>
        <p> But living alone, I've started making a savoury version of Upma that was more to my liking. And here is the recipe</p>
        <h2><span>Ingredients</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Roasted Sooji &#45; 1 Cup</li>
            <li>Onion &#45; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> Cup (chopped)</li>
            <li>Carrot &#45; 1 (Optional)</li>
            <li>Cahsews &#45; 6 (Optional)</li>
            <li>Oil &#45; 1 Tsp</li>
            <li>Ginger &#45; 1 Inch</li>
            <li>Salt &#45; 1 Pinch</li>
            <li>Green Chili &#45; 1 Chopped</li>
            <li> Ghee &#45; 1 Tsp</li>
            <li>Water &#45; 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> Cp</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span>Instructions</span></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy bottomed pan, roast the sooji on a low flame till you get a nice aroma. Once done, set it aside </li>
            <li>In the same pan, heat some oil. Saut&eacute; onion, ginger and green chili for 3 minutes till the raw smell goes away</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables and cashews now, and saut&eacute; for 2 more minutes</li>
            <li>Add water and salt and bring to a rolling boil. The water must taste a little salty</li>
            <li> Slowly mix in the Sooji to the upma so as to not form lumps. Cook covered for 5 mins</li>
            <li>Add the ghee and mix well. Turn off the heat and let it rest covered for 10 more minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
