        <h1>This is Vishak&#39;s Cookbook</h1>
        <p> One fine day in June 2021, in the middle of the pandemic. When I was whiling my time away in Pune, I had the brilliant idea to look for a job in Germany</p>
        <p> And I did. And now I'm living here. All by myself. Having to cook my own meals</p>
        <p> And so for the last year, I've been solely responsible for all my meals. And I'm still alive. So how bad can it be, right?</p>
        <p>So anyway, here's a bunch fo recipes for you to try out</p>
        <h2>Vishak&#39; Breakfast Recipes</h2>
        <p>A healthy breakfast is the best possible way to start the day. Or so they say. And so I think. Here&#39;s a bunch of Vishak Approved recipes straight from my kitchen</p>
